# Big O

## Complexity Analysis

- Space Complexity
- Time Complexity

    f(ar[])

        for( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++)

            sum = ar[]

        return sum

As input grows the growth in time - here T = O(n)

## Time Compexity Analysis

The above one is Linear Time Complexity

Now next,

    f(ar[])
        v = a[0]
    return v

This is Constant Time Complexity, T = O(1)

Now Quadratic Time Complexity, T =  O(n^2)

    for()

        for()


## Space Complexity

    f(ar[])
        for(i = 0; i < n, i++)
            temp = ar[i]
    O(1) - as we are using only one variable
