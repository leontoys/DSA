# Linked List

Similar to Treaure Hunt

Array - contiguous memory

Linked List - Non-contiguous

Set/Get/Traverse

    In array we can access by inde and set value
    In Linked List, we don't usually access by poistion and set
    Still if we have to, we need to traverse through the linked list and compare and find by position or value
    Hence, 
    Time Complexity is O(n)T
    Space Complexity is O(1)S

Insert

    If we have to insert in the head or tail, we can do it instantly, if we store these which we usually do
    O(1)TS
    If we don't store head or tail, then we have to traverse to find the end, hence
    O(n)T and O(1)S
    If we have to insert in the middle, yes you guessed it right, we have to traverse, hence
    O(n)T and O(1)S

Delete

    If we have to delete something, we hae to travers
    So O(n)T and O(1)S

Init
    To initialize we need only one to start with, hence
    O(1)TS
